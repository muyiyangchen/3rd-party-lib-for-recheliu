%   X = U*S*V'
%
% update it to be the SVD of
%
%   X + ab' = Up*Sp*Vp'
%
% that is, implement a rank-one update to the SVD of X.
%
% Depending on a,b there may be considerable structure that could
% be exploited, but which this code does not.
%
% The subspace rotations involved may not preserve orthogonality due
% to numerical round-off errors.  To compensate, you can set the
% "force_orth" flag, which will force orthogonality via a QR plus
% another SVD.  In a long loop, you may want to force orthogonality
% every so often.
