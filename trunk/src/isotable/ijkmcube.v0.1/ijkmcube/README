genisosurface:

Marching Cubes algorithm for for generating isosurfaces in arbitrary 
(small) dimensions.

ijkmcube.cxx, ijkmcube.h: Main program.  

isosurfaceD.cxx, isosurface.h: Generate an isosurface from a scalar field.

ijktable.cxx, ijktable.h: Class ISOSURFACE_TABLE for storing isosurface tables.


Note: ijkmcube reads the isosurface table from the directory
isotable_directory.  Edit ijkmcube.cxx and set the
isotable_directory to the proper directory before compiling
ijkmcube.cxx.


INPUT FORMAT: ijkmcube reads regular grid data from standard input.
Input format is Nrrd.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Output format is the dimension, followed by the length
of each grid axis, the number of isosurface vertices, a list of
isosurface vertex coordinates, the number of isosurface simplices, and
a list of isosurface simplex vertices (indices to the list of vertex
coordinates.)
